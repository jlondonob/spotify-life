# Spotify-life 

I've loved music from the minute I was born ðŸŽ¶. I've learned to use it to shape my feelings, to focus, to increase my sensitivity. But I've also listened to it in a **context** and as a result of the different circumstances I'm in.

Thanks to Spotify's [Data Download](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/), and their amazing [Free API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/),  all the people that express and communicate through music can now unwind their own story!
